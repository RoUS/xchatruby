===============================

Installation
------------

If you received a binary version of this plugin (already compiled), simply
do the following, depending on your operating system:

  LINUX: copy the xchat-ruby.so file to your ~/.xchat2 directory.
  WINDOWS: copy the xchat-ruby.dll file to your XChat home or global XChat
    plugins directory (see under 'Compiling' for more information about
    where these directories are).
  
This will cause the ruby plugin to be loaded automatically when you run XChat.

You don't need to have ruby installed, but it's a good idea (since some of
the plugins you may use with the ruby plugin may need optional functionality
that is shipped with the ruby interpreter).  If you have ruby installed, you
can set up the ruby environment for the XChat-Ruby plugin by typing the
following:

    ruby -e 'puts $LOAD_PATH.join("\n")' > rubyenv

Then, copy the rubyenv file to your XChat home directory.

Sample plugins written in ruby may be found in the 'samples' subdirectory.

If you have any plugins written in ruby that you want automatically loaded
when you start XChat, you must (1) make sure the xchat-ruby.so plugin is
loaded on start up, and (2) put the ruby scripts in your xchat2 home
directory (the scripts MUST be suffixed with .rb).


Compiling
---------

If you received a source package of XChat-Ruby, you can build and install
the plugin by doing the following, based on your operating system:

  LINUX:
    cd src
    make
    make install

  WINDOWS:
    cd src
    win32\make

You MUST have ruby installed and in your path for either method to work.
The 'make install' step under Linux will copy the xchat-ruby.so file to
your home xchat2 directory, and will also automatically initialize the ruby
environment for the plugin.

For Windows, the installation is not automatic (yet): you'll need to copy
the xchat-ruby.dll file to either your XChat home directory or the global
XChat plugins directory:

  XChat home:
    C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\X-Chat 2

  Global XChat plugins directory:
    C:\Program Files\XChat\plugins

You should also copy the 'rubyenv' file to your XChat home directory.
