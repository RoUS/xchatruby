XChat-Ruby Plugin v. 0.1

===============================

Installation
------------

If you received a binary version of this plugin (already compiled), simply
copy the xchat-ruby.so file to your ~/.xchat2 directory.  This will cause
the ruby plugin to be loaded automatically when you run XChat.

You don't need to have ruby installed, but it's a good idea (since some of
the plugins you may use with the ruby plugin may need optional functionality
that is shipped with the ruby interpreter).  If you have ruby installed, you
can set up the ruby environment for the XChat-Ruby plugin by typing the
following:

  ruby -e 'puts $LOAD_PATH.join("\n")' > ~/.xchat2/rubyenv

Sample plugins written in ruby may be found in the 'samples' subdirectory.

If you have any plugins written in ruby that you want automatically loaded
when you start XChat, you must (1) make sure the xchat-ruby.so plugin is
loaded on start up, and (2) put the ruby scripts in your xchat2 home
directory (the scripts MUST be suffixed with .rb).


Compiling
---------

If you received a source package of XChat-Ruby, you can build and install
the plugin by doing the following:

  cd src
  make
  make install

You MUST have ruby installed and in your path for this to work. This will
copy the xchat-ruby.so file to your home xchat2 directory, and will also
automatically initialize the ruby environment for the plugin.
