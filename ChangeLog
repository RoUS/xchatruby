XChat-Ruby Plugin
-----------------

v1.2: 25 Apr 2007
  - Fixed bug 1705938: print, puts, print_fmt, puts_fmt with 3 arguments works
  - Fixed bug 1295417: print_fmt doesn't does print instead of puts
  - Fixed bug 1049124: Compile with -fPIC to support AMD64.
  - Added makefile for compiling a universal shared library on Mac
    OS X 10.4
  - Makefile: added variables, uninstall
  - samples/JBanner.rb: added brackets around arguments (fix ruby warning)
  - xchat-ruby.c: Moved version string to the top of the file

v1.1: 8 Aug 2003
  - Fixed bugs that caused priorities to not be respected, and caused hooks
    with the same name to conflict (the older hook was being removed).  Hook
    return codes should now be understood correctly as well.
  - Made the internal ruby code more 1.8-compliant.  This should have zero
    effect if you only have 1.6.x installed, though.

v1.0.1: 9 June 2003
  Very minor modifications in order to support compilation under Win32.

v1.0: 9 June 2003
  Initial release.
